# Week7_SecE_Activity1_StepperMotor

**Stepper Motor Programming Assignments** 

This repository contains structured programming tasks designed to help students understand stepper motor control using ESP32 and MicroPython. 

Students are expected to write the code independently to achieve the specified functional behavior. 

**Code 1 : StepperMotor_1 – Continuous Rotation (Single Direction)** 

Objective : Write a program to rotate the stepper motor continuously in one direction. 

Expected Functional Behavior : 

The motor should rotate continuously (clockwise or counterclockwise). 

The stepping sequence must be implemented using a list. 

**Code 2 : StepperMotor_2 – Two Complete Rotations** 

Objective : Write a program to rotate the stepper motor exactly two full revolutions and then stop. 

Expected Functional Behavior :

The motor should complete two full rotations. 

After completing the rotations, the motor must stop. 

**Code 3 : StepperMotor_3 – Continuous Bidirectional Rotation** 

Objective : Write a program where the motor performs one full rotation in one direction followed by one full rotation in the opposite direction, continuously. 

Expected Functional Behavior :

One complete clockwise rotation. 

One complete counterclockwise rotation. 

This sequence should repeat continuously. 

**Code 4 : StepperMotor_TwoPushButton – Continuous Direction Control Using Two Push Buttons** 

Objective : Write a program to control motor direction using two push buttons. 

Expected Functional Behavior :

Button 1 → Motor rotates continuously clockwise. 

Button 2 → Motor rotates continuously counterclockwise. 

The motor should respond in real time to button input. 

**Code 5 : StepperMotor_TwoPushButtons – 90° Position Control Using Two Push Buttons** 

Objective ; Write a program to control precise angular displacement using push buttons. 

Expected Functional Behavior :

Button 1 → Shaft rotates 90° clockwise and stops. 

Button 2 → Shaft rotates 90° counterclockwise and stops. 

**Code 6 : StepperMotor_OnePushButton – Direction Toggle Using One Push Button** 

Objective : Write a program to change the motor direction using a single push button. 

Expected Functional Behavior : 

On each button press, the direction of rotation should toggle.
